Play Resistance and Avalon with your phone, and keep your friends from cheating!

This app lets you play Resistance, along with its expansion game, Avalon, on your phone. Resistance is a party game for 5-10 players. It is a social deduction game, similar to Mafia or Werewolf. This app lets you play Resistance without having to use any of the game pieces, and only one person has to have it on their phone. The app keeps track of everything, from names to roles to passes and fails. It also contains an in-depth explanation of the rules. The biggest benefit, however, is that the app removes the need for a night phase where everyone is supposed to close their eyes. This means that nobody can cheat by peeking.
